    <div className={styles.title}>Unveiling the World of Programming with C: A Journey into Creating a Restaurant Billing System</div>

    <div className={styles.mainbody}>
        <div className={styles.subtitle}>Introduction</div>
        <p>Embarking on a journey into the realm of programming marked the beginning of an exciting and challenging adventure for me. My exploration took a fascinating turn when I decided to delve into the foundations of the C programming language. In this blog post, I share my experiences in mastering the basics of C and applying that knowledge to craft a simple yet functional restaurant billing system.</p>

        <div className={styles.subtitle}>Chapter 1: The Basics of C</div>
        <p>The journey commenced with understanding the fundamental concepts of C programming. Concepts like variables, data types, loops, and conditional statements formed the bedrock of my programming knowledge. I delved into the intricacies of functions, learning how to structure code to promote modularity and reusability. This phase laid a robust foundation, preparing me for more complex challenges ahead.</p>

        <div className={styles.subtitle}>Chapter 2: Navigating the C Landscape</div>
        <p>As I honed my skills in C, I transitioned from basic syntax to more advanced topics such as pointers and arrays. The ability to manipulate memory addresses and efficiently handle collections of data opened up new possibilities. I discovered the elegance and power that C offered, setting the stage for more sophisticated programming endeavors.</p>

        <div className={styles.subtitle}>Chapter 3: Crafting the Restaurant Billing System</div>
        <p>Inspired by the desire to apply my newfound C programming skills to a real-world project, I embarked on the development of a restaurant billing system. The vision was to create a simple yet functional program that simulated the process of ordering food and calculating the total bill. This project would serve as a practical application of the concepts I had mastered thus far.</p>

        <div className={styles.subtitle}>Chapter 4: Designing the System Architecture</div>
        <p>Planning and designing the architecture of the billing system required thoughtful consideration. I conceptualized the structure using fundamental C constructs, employing structures to represent menu items and orders. This step laid the groundwork for a modular and organized system that could handle the intricacies of a restaurant environment.</p>

        <div className={styles.subtitle}>Chapter 5: Implementing Core Functionality</div>
        <p>With the architecture in place, I began implementing core functionalities. Displaying the menu, placing orders, and calculating the total bill became the focus. Leveraging my knowledge of functions, loops, and conditional statements, I crafted the logic that would simulate the dynamic interaction between a customer and the billing system.</p>

        <div className={styles.subtitle}>Chapter 6: Iterative Refinement</div>
        <p>Building the restaurant billing system was not a linear process; it involved constant refinement. Iterative cycles of testing, debugging, and enhancing the code became the norm. Each iteration brought improvements, from refining user interactions to optimizing the efficiency of the code. This iterative approach not only improved the functionality but also reinforced my understanding of debugging strategies.</p>

        <div className={styles.subtitle}>Conclusion</div>
        <p>The journey from learning the basics of C to developing a restaurant billing system was a rewarding and enlightening experience. It showcased the versatility and power of C as a programming language. Crafting a real-world application provided valuable insights into problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and the joy of seeing code come to life.</p>

        <p>As I conclude this chapter of my programming journey, I reflect on the growth and confidence gained. The restaurant billing system, though simple, represents a significant milestone. Armed with the knowledge acquired, I look forward to exploring more advanced programming languages and tackling increasingly complex projects.</p>

        <p>Programming is not just about code; it's a journey of continuous learning, problem-solving, and creativity. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, every line of code written adds to the story of your growth. Happy coding!</p>
